# Discord Themes

This repo is a collection of discord themes I wrote/will write because currently the only theme is one I made to match the spicetify [Dribblish](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes/tree/master/Dribbblish) theme with the Horizon colour scheme.

There a few things I didn't quite finish on it like the setting pages or some media player components, so feel free to make a PR with any changes or fixes.

You will need something like [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/BetterDiscord/Installer) to be able to use this theme.
